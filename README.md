# JFIF To Jpg
 A simple python script for changing file extensions of .jfif and .jpg_large files saved from twitter to a discord friendly .jpg extension  
 Made mostly for myself since I found manually renaming images to send them to my friends to be a real pain in the ass

# Usage instructions:
Install Python if it's not already installed
Download the jfif to jpg.py file on this repo
Copy it to your folder containing .jfif files
Run Terminal or cmd, navigated to the folder and run this command:
python "jfif to jpg.py"
